# Travis Helton car sale

Welcome! 


- Your code will go into the src folder. I have made a notebook file for you to work in. As you progress we will move things from the notebook to the correct file structures like we are deploying this project. 
- Always work on a branch and not in main. 
- push like normal 
- when you have big things done do a pull request and we will merge it into main! :) 

### GitHub basics for working on branches etc
